How to convert py to exe:

Step 1: install cx-Freeze

pip install --upgrade cx_Freeze


Step 2: Create a file: setup.py with the content as below:

import sys
from cx_Freeze import setup, Executable

# Dependencies are automatically detected, but it might need fine tuning.
# "packages": ["os"] is used as example only
build_exe_options = {"packages": ["os"], "excludes": ["tkinter"]}

# base="Win32GUI" should be used only for Windows GUI app
base = None
if sys.platform == "win32":
    base = "Win32GUI"

setup(
    name = "guifoo",
    version = "0.1",
    description = "My GUI application!",
    options = {"build_exe": build_exe_options},

# Change the "guifoo.py" to your file name.
    executables = [Executable("guifoo.py", base=base)]
)

Step 3: 

- Build exe file:
python setup.py build

- Build installer containing all the files cx_Freeze includes for your application:

python setup.py bdist_msi
